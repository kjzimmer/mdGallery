        <p>My art journey began early on as a child. Spending summers on my grand - parents farm in southern Florida with a herd of horses and a variety of other animals only encouraged the creative aspirations within.  If I wasn’t out riding a horse, I would be indoors sketching or painting horses. By the time I reached my late teens I had a strong focus on art classes in high school and had a watercolor painting and pencil drawing awarded to the ‘Smithsonian Museum’ and attended ‘Crealde Art Institute’ from a scholarship offered in my senior year of high school. Though I took a photography class rather than a painting class, this helped me to understand the importance of capturing ‘light’, this translates in my work even today.
            During my late teens and early twenties, I spent most of my summers attending art shows throughout Florida, including the highly recognized ‘Winter Park’ Art show. During my early twenties I got involved in Interior Design and didn’t create art for years. It would be in my late forties before I had the desire to begin creating again.
            Turning 50, I moved west to Colorado from the east with intentions of getting back to my creative roots. I have been a full time artist since 2014. A self-taught artist with no formal training since graduating high school. I constantly challenge myself and study building my artistic skills and develop the style that I have reached to date. With a blend of realism and surrealism how I approach each unique piece. I have been called prolific in my work and am known for the intense color palette and emotion conveyed in each piece. The impact the west during my first ‘wild horse range’ trip in NW Colorado has kept my passion fueled. Little did I know the impact that first trip would make on my journey of creating art.
            The paintings I create in oil  inspired by the land, the wild, and the wild mustang that call these western lands home. I would call myself a ‘purist’ in my artistic approach as I do not use projector or grids, rather continue to develop eye to hand to canvas skill.  The them and color palette of my work is vivid, bringing the experiences I have encountered alive to retell their story on canvas.  I have spent the last 14 years traveling across the western states on rugged open range photographing and exploring the wild of our west. My story has been told in newspaper articles, magazines, and radio over the years, and continues to be told today with each new range trip traversing across rugged landscapes, and spending studio time recreating those cherished experiences.</p>
